# Automatic-Image-Colorization

Our task is to convert given grey-scale image into colorized(RGB) image.

## Objective

Given a grayscale image input, our objective is to find out its believable color image without any manual intervention. Accomplishing this task is a difficult problem because there is often no “correct” attainable color for a given image as the color of the t-shirt can be anything from white to red or black.  

## Lab Color Space

It is also known as [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space). 

It is expressed in three numerical values *(L,a,b)* as
- **L(Luminance)** for the lightness 
- **a** for the green–red color components
- **b** for the blue–yellow color components
