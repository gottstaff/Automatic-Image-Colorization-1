We simply put the L channel in CNN and put the ab channel as target here $L\\in R^{HxW}$ and $ab \\in R^{HxWx2}$ we Train on L and want to predict the ab and then merge both of them to get the colorized image . We can frame this as a per pixel regression problem Where our object is to minimize the L2 Objective function or simply the euclidean distance . If our ground truth from ab is Y and the predicted ab is Y'. We say our objective is to minimize . \n",
